### HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Ash, I have a long time interest in Android and AOSP in both a personal and professinoal capacity. I am always keen to learn more. 
##### Currently off sick indefinitely and using the free time to build AOSP for some of my devices, and play around with different apps and modules.

#### Devices I own:
- Pixel 7 Pro ( cheetah )
- Pixel 5 ( redfin )
- Nothing Phone 2 ( pong )
- POCO F6 ( peridot )
- POCO F3 ( alioth )
- OnePlus 8 Pro ( instantnoodlep )
- OnePlus 7 Pro ( guacamole )
- And a few more older OnePlus and Pixel devices.

#####  I am usually happy to help with testing with most of my devices. Reach out via  [Telegram](https://t.me/AndroidAsh) or Github comments.

### HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Ash, I have a long time interest in Android and AOSP. I am always keen to learn more. 
##### Currently off sick indefinitely and using the free time to build AOSP for some of my devices, hoping to further improve my skills and knowlegde, and occasionally playing around with different apps and modules.

#### Devices I own:
- Pixel 7 Pro ( cheetah )
- Pixel 5 ( redfin )
- Pixel 3 XL ( crosshatch )
- Nothing Phone 2 ( pong )
- POCO F3 ( alioth )
- OnePlus 8 Pro ( instantnoodlep )
- OnePlus 7 Pro ( guacamole )
- OnePlus 6T ( fajita )
- And a few more older OnePlus, Pixel, Nexus and HTC devices.

#####  I am usually happy to help with testing with most of my devices. Reach out via  [Telegram](https://t.me/AndroidAsh) or Github comments.
